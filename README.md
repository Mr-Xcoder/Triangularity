# Welcome to Triangularity!

This is a recreational programming language, very minimalistic, that doesn't yet have any kind of loops, and which is only meant to solve easy tasks. 

"Hello, World!" program:

    ....... .......
    ......   ......
    .....     .....
    ....       ....
    ...         ...
    ..           ..
    .             .
    "Hello, World!"

Or, much shorter:

    .... ....
    ..."!"...
    .."rld"..
    ."o, Wo".
    "Hell"+++

**Fun fact:** Valid Triangularity programs must have the character count listed in [OEIS A056220](https://oeis.org/A056220) (except for -1), otherwise you are probably doing something wrong.
